Developed a snake game using Java graphical user interfaces (GUI) and object-oriented concepts.

body.
● Implemented a user-friendly reset feature that allows players to start over upon collision.<img width="1117" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-12 at 7 47 32 AM" src="https://github.com/ImrulNYC/SnakeGame-Java/assets/147569091/4fa12992-6a45-4f35-a6f4-8dca82ef9f39">
